# Chat and agent controls

The controls above and below the composer define how the next prompt is run.
They are stored on the chat, and most selections also become the starting
preference for new chats.

## Configure a run

Before sending a prompt:

1. Select **Codex**, **Claude**, **Kimi**, **Antigravity**, **OpenCode**, or
   **Freebuff** in the **Provider** toggle.
2. Open **Model** and choose a provider-supported model or **Auto**.
3. Optionally open **Skill set**, search the catalog, and select one or more
   skills.
4. Set **Thinking** when the provider exposes reasoning effort.
5. Set **Speed** when using Codex and a model that supports service tiers.
6. Set **Mode** for the task.
7. Write and send the prompt.

**Outcome:** Remote saves the selections to the chat and uses them to construct
the next provider CLI run. Provider, model, thinking, and speed cannot be
changed while that chat is streaming.

## Provider and model choices

| Provider | Current **Model** choices | Additional controls |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Codex** | **Auto**, **GPT-5.6 Sol**, **GPT-5.5**, **GPT-5.4**, **GPT-5.4 Mini**, **GPT-5.3 Codex** | **Thinking**, **Speed**, Codex skills |
| **Claude** | **Auto**, **Fable**, **Opus**, **Sonnet**, **Haiku** | **Thinking**, Claude skills |
| **Kimi** | **Auto** | No current thinking or speed selector |
| **Antigravity** | **Auto** | **Thinking** at Auto, Low, Medium, or High |
| **OpenCode** | **Auto**, **Claude Opus 4.5**, **Claude Sonnet 4.5**, **Claude Haiku 4.5**, **GPT-5.4**, **GPT-5.4 Mini** | **Thinking**, OpenCode skills, browser MCP |
| **Freebuff** | **Auto** | No thinking or speed selector; interactive TUI only |

OpenCode **Model** choices are `provider/model` IDs routed through the CLI:
Anthropic entries use the **ANTHROPIC_API_KEY** project secret and OpenAI
entries use **OPENAI_API_KEY**. The workspace's own `opencode.json` can still
override the model or add more.

**Auto** omits an explicit model so the provider chooses its configured
default. Model availability and account entitlements are ultimately enforced
by the provider; a listed choice can still fail if the connected account does
not have access.

Switching providers clears the previous model, reasoning effort, service tier,
and selected skills because those values may not be compatible with the new
provider.

## Thinking and speed

**Thinking** controls provider reasoning effort:

- Codex: **Auto**, **None**, **Minimal**, **Low**, **Medium**, **High**,
  **XHigh**, **Max**, and **Ultra**.
- Claude: **Auto**, **Low**, **Medium**, **High**, **XHigh**, **Max**, and
  **Ultra**.
- Antigravity: **Auto**, **Low**, **Medium**, and **High**.
- OpenCode: **Auto**, **None**, **Low**, **Medium**, **High**, **XHigh**, and
  **Max**. Remote passes the selection as opencode's `--variant`
  (provider-specific reasoning effort); an effort the chosen model doesn't
  advertise is silently ignored by opencode, so unsupported pairs fall back
  to the model default instead of erroring.
- Kimi: no current selector.

**Auto** omits the explicit effort flag. The provider or model then chooses its
default. Higher labels request more reasoning; they can increase latency and
usage, and unsupported provider/model combinations may be rejected upstream.

**Speed** is currently a Codex-only service-tier selector:

- **Auto** omits an explicit tier.
- **Default** requests the normal tier.
- **Priority** requests priority service.
- **Fast** requests the fast tier.

Tier availability, behavior, cost, and quotas belong to the connected provider
account. Remote does not guarantee that every model accepts every tier.

## Modes are advisory

| **Mode** | Prompt guidance added by Remote |
| --- | --- |
| **Chat** | Answer directly and avoid file changes unless requested |
| **Plan** | Inspect and propose a concrete plan before editing |
| **Code** | Use the provider's normal implementation behavior |
| **Review** | Lead with bugs, regressions, missing tests, and risks |
| **Debug** | Reproduce or localize first, then make the smallest root-cause fix |
| **Full auto** | Continue through implementation and verification unless blocked |

Modes are prompt policy, not a security or permission boundary. They do not
technically prevent an agent from running commands or editing files. Project
agents run as root inside their unprivileged container, and the provider CLIs
are launched in approval-free modes. For Claude Code project runs, the
approval gate pauses destructive shell commands (recursive deletes of
filesystem roots, `mkfs`/`dd` on block devices, fork bombs, `curl|sh`, and
similar) and shows an **Approve and run** / **Deny** card in the chat before
they execute; a timeout or canceled run denies by default. Codex, Kimi, and
OpenCode runs are not gated yet. Review proposed actions and use project
isolation, Git, resource limits, and backups as the other control layers.

Changing **Mode** while a run is already active affects a later prompt, not the
provider process that is currently producing output.

## Select skills

1. Select **Skill set**.
2. Use **Search Claude skills** or **Search Codex skills** when needed.
3. Select a skill by name. Its source badge identifies where it was found.
4. Repeat to combine skills.
5. Remove a selected-skill chip before sending if it is not needed.

The catalog combines host skills and, for a project chat, accessible
project-workspace skills. A provider change clears selected skills.

Current provider caveats:

- Claude receives a provider-specific slash-style skill trigger generated by
  Remote.
- Codex receives a provider-specific dollar-style skill instruction generated
  by Remote.
- Kimi can display and store selected skill references, but the current prompt
  path does not inject an equivalent trigger. Do not rely on Kimi skill
  selection yet.
- Antigravity has the same general selected-skill limitation as Kimi. The
  built-in **Scheduled Tasks** skill is the exception: Remote passes its
  project skill path explicitly so Antigravity can use it.
- OpenCode follows the same selected-skill pattern as Kimi/Antigravity, with
  the same **Scheduled Tasks** exception. Its model, provider, and MCP
  configuration live in the workspace's `opencode.json`.
- Freebuff is interactive-only: selected skills are displayed but cannot be
  injected into its TUI session.
- The browser skill prepares browser MCP access for Claude, Codex, and
  OpenCode: Claude and Codex receive per-run flags, and OpenCode gets the
  `browser` MCP server written into its global config in the container.
  Kimi and Antigravity do not get MCP browser tools.

These generated triggers are an internal integration detail. The composer does
not currently implement general-purpose user `@` mentions or slash commands.

## Antigravity sign-in and output

Antigravity does not appear in **Settings → Agents** because its `agy` CLI has
no host-wide login flow that Remote can safely complete and copy.

Before the first Antigravity prompt in a project:

1. Open that project's **Terminal**.
2. Run `agy`.
3. Complete the URL-and-code sign-in shown by the CLI.
4. Close the interactive CLI after sign-in.
5. Return to the chat, choose **Antigravity**, and send the prompt.

The sign-in is project-local. It survives normal container stop/start, but its
files live under `/root/.gemini` in the replaceable container root and are lost
when Remote replaces the container during an upgrade or recovery. Run `agy`
again after replacement.

Antigravity print mode streams plain assistant text. It does not currently
provide Remote's structured tool cards or usage totals. It can resume its
conversation while the CLI brain directory remains present; a fork starts a
fresh Antigravity conversation.

## Running-state rules

- A chat permits one active prompt run at a time.
- Separate chats can run in parallel.
- While a chat is working, its header reads the provider name and **Working**;
  the sidebar shows a spinner.
- A second prompt entered in that chat is queued in the loaded page rather than
  started concurrently.
- Select **Cancel** or press Escape to request cancellation of the current run.

The server enforces the one-run-per-chat lock, but queued prompts are a browser
feature. See [Prompts, context, and conversation](04-prompts-context-and-conversation.md)
for queue persistence and recovery behavior.

## Isolation warning for loose chats

These controls are also shown for **Loose chat**, but the execution boundary is
different. A loose chat runs its approval-free provider CLI directly as the
backend service user on the host—root in production—not inside a project
container. Use a project chat unless fully trusted host-level execution is
intended.
